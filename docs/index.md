## I need help!

If you need some help with Velocity, please seek help in the following places:

### ðŸ“– This Wiki

We have put a lot of effort into documenting Velocity as much as possible with our
new website and our coverage will continue to expand. We strongly encourage you to
check the sidebar of the wiki for relevant resources. Helping yourself using the
resources in this wiki saves all of us time.

We recommend you visit the <Link to="/wiki/users/faq/">frequently-asked questions</Link>
to begin your search. Most common issues with Velocity are answered there.

Please do not be offended if we respond to your question linking back here. Asking us a question
already answered in the documentation doesn't help anyone.

### ðŸ’¬ Our Discord

If you have searched the wiki and didn't find the answer to your question, then it is time
to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/8cB9Bgf) to ask your question.
